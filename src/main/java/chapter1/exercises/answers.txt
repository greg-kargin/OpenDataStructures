2.1
  The extra non-null value is a copy of last element from backing array, which appeared after
  we moved every element left by 1.
  [1,2,3,4,5] -> delete(3) -> [1,2,3,5,5]

2.2
  When we execute add(_, i) operation we copy sub-array (n - i, n) one position left, if we repeat
  this operation multiple times we would get O(n^2) time. To make multiple insertions it is easier
  to copy array by number of elements we are going to insert.
  [1,2,3,4,5] -> [1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,5] -> [1,2,3,4,9,9,9,9,5]
